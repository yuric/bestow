*******Priority TODOS*******

1- Alerts send email when coupon is created within the area
2- Page Redirect: If the page does not exist I need to redirect the user to an 404 and what not page. I can use the layout I have for the site and incorporate it into the 404 error page. Error page should be recognizable as my site's page.
3- Some kind of user sign up control ( Maybe BETA Invitations Railscast 124, also have a list of emails to allow sign up)
4- Determine the logic of a Business sign up and helping a non-profit to a non-profit helping themselves or even other nonprofit

*Interface
1- Reset/unlock, autenticate, all those views need to be worked on
2- Consider a small map image of location and when user clicks it a javascript object appears on screen with a large draggable map

*Other
1- Privacy policy needs to be worked on
2- Coupons, bsForm looks
