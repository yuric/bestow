Hi,

I am new to rails as a whole and I am also having trouble with this plugin in production. I am deploying to heroku but it will not work when deployed, even the example will not deploy properly. There is some debate around this issue (similar) on the link bellow.

Env: Rails 3, Ruby 1.8.7 Heroku log error: where CouponsController is where I have the map set up and index where I display it.

[NameError (uninitialized constant CouponsController::Cartographer): app/controllers/coupons_controller.rb:107:in initialize_map' app/controllers/coupons_controller.rb:51:inindex' ]

This is the line causing trouble: @map = Cartographer::Gmap.new( 'map' )

Why is it initialized in dev but not in prod? Thank you for being patience. Any direction is appreciated.
